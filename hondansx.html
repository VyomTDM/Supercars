<h1>Honda NSX</h1>
<p>We feel it at the start of every project, no matter what the car. But with the NSX it was special â€“ deeper somehow. Youâ€™ll know it when you feel it. And when you do, youâ€™ll understand why this car means more to us than anything weâ€™ve ever created before. Blending the pinnacle of sports performance with everyday driving comfort took time to achieve. It came with its fair share of setbacks, too. But if accomplishing perfection meant starting over again, and again, and again â€“ that's what we'd do. It's why the car took years to perfect, and why the NSX only got better with time. This was the foundation of the new NSX: a powerful sports hybrid. But with more power came further challenges. To control that power we switched our attention to the driver â€“ it stretched our minds in many different ways and the result is a feeling of total connection as you drive; an affinity never thought possible. Inside the newly refurbished â€“ and purpose built Â­â€“ Performance Centre in Ohio, only the NSX chassis and paint process is handled by specially made machines. The rest of the car is started and finished by hand. And it's this human touch that makes the NSX so special.</p>

<p>When you drive the NSX, itâ€™s hard to know where your body ends and the car begins. You're in complete contact with the car. The engine and drivetrain combinations can be configured in many different ways to give you perfect feel when cornering, accelerating and braking â€“ wherever you are. 645 Nm torque with Launch Control. 581 PS Super Handling All-Wheel Drive.  The second-generation Honda NSX has been unveiled in its final production form on the first day of the 2015 Detroit motor show. Again badged as the Acura NSX in North America, Hondaâ€™s long-awaited second-generation NSX features a hybrid drivetrain with a mid-mounted 75-degree dry sump V6 and a nine-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission</p>
