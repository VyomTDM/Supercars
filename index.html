<p>Hello. Welcome to Supercar.com. Here you will find information about ten supercars which you will have to read and answer question after each one.</p>
<h1>McLaren Senna</h1>
<p>The McLaren Senna has a single-minded purpose. In the pursuit of the most rewarding and intuitive driving experience, pioneering active aerodynamics generate unprecedented levels of downforce. It is also the lightest vehicle we have built since the iconic F1, with our most powerful road car engine to date. This combination creates a staggering power-to-weight ratio of 668PS-per-tonne (659bhp). It is the most direct and responsive McLaren ever built, surpassing even the McLaren P1™ GTR, to create the purest connection with the driver. The McLaren Senna is a new track benchmark for McLaren. The McLaren Senna is the ultimate distillation of the company’s ‘form follows function’ design mantra. To observe the detailed work that has gone into every aerodynamic element of the McLaren Senna is mesmerising. To experience it all working in unison is truly incredible. The resulting 800kg of downforce in Race mode at significantly less than maximum speed (155mph or 250km/h) is phenomenal, and the McLaren Senna creates, maintains and controls its aerodynamic performance to ensure the driver has the confidence to explore the limits such downforce unlocks. We think of the McLaren Senna as a race car – we have designed and built it to perform on the track first and foremost. The active aerodynamics are pioneering, and the unprecedented visibility achieved through the unique glazed doors gives the driver total confidence. Exhaustive, fearless engineering has led us to revaluate and reassess every component, no matter how small or insignificant, to maximise performance. We have used carbon fibre for the monocoque, the body and everywhere we need lightness, rigidity and strength – it is the reason the McLaren Senna is the lightest road vehicle McLaren Automotive has ever built.</p>
