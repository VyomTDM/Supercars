<h1>Ferrari 488 GTB</h1>
<p>The 488 GTB name marks a return to the classic Ferrari model designation with the 488 in its moniker indicating the engine's unitary displacement, while the GTB stands for Gran Turismo Berlineta. The Ferrari 488 (Type F142M) is a mid-engine sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. The car replaced the 458, being the first mid-engine Ferrari to use a turbocharged V8 since the F40. The 488 GTB is powered by a 3,902 cc (3.9 L; 238.1 cu in) (488 cc per cylinder, thus the name) all-aluminum dry sump unit of the Ferrari F154 V8 engine family.[3] Turbocharged with two parallel ball-bearing twin-scroll turbochargers supplied by IHI/Honeywell and two air-to-air intercoolers, the turbine wheels are made of low-density TiAl alloy often used in jet engines to reduce inertia and resist high temperatures within the turbocharger. The engine generates a power output of 670 PS (493 kW; 661 hp) at 8,000 rpm and 760 Nâ‹…m (561 lbâ‹…ft) of torque at 3,000 rpm.[9] This results in a specific power output of 126.3 kW (171.7 PS; 169.4 hp) per litre and specific torque output of 194.8 Nâ‹…m (144 lbâ‹…ft) per litre, both records for a Ferrari automobile. </p>
<p>Improved carbon-ceramic brakes are used on the 488, derived from technology used in the LaFerrari, constructed with new materials that reduce the time needed to achieve optimum operating temperature. Disc sizes are 398 mm at the front, and 360 mm at the rear. These advancements reportedly reduce stopping distances by 9% over the 458. A new five-spoke alloy wheel was designed for the 488, measuring 51 cm (20 in) at front and rear respectively. Front tyres measure 245/35 and the rear tyres 305/30. Claimed manufacturer performance for the 488 GTB is 0â€“100 km/h (0â€“62 mph) in 3.0 seconds, 0â€“200 km/h (0â€“124 mph) in 8.3 seconds, covering the quarter mile in 10.45 seconds and continuing to a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph). The body of the 488 has been designed to increase downforce by 50% over the 458 while reducing aerodynamic drag.[12] A new front double splitter serves two functions: increasing radiator cooling by forcing air into them and also channeling the air over the underbody vortex generators to create ground effect without adding unwanted drag. A newly designed rear spoiler (actually a slotted flap) integrated into the rear decklid and bumper increases downforce without requiring a raised wing.[13] The central "Aero Pillar" deflects air under the flat body of the car while two vents in the bonnet provide an exit for air from the dual intakes of the front bumper, further reducing air pressure over the front of the car.[14]</p>
