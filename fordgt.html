<h1>Ford GT</h1>
<p>From its 3.5-litre EcoBoost technology to its ultra-efficient aerodynamics, the Ford GT is the culmination of everything great we do at Ford. And itâ€™s the same passion for innovation that can be seen throughout our entire vehicle line up. Innovation. Thatâ€™s what the Ford GT is all about. When the Ford GT was first announced, the demand outpaced supply, and the cars initially sold for premium prices. The first private sale of Ford's new mid-engine sports car was completed on August 4, 2004, when former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley took delivery of his Midnight Blue 2005 Ford GT. Shirley earned the right to purchase the first production Ford GT (chassis #10) at a charity auction at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance Auction after bidding over US$557,000.</p>

<p>A few other early cars sold for as much as a US$100,000 premium over the suggested retail price of US$139,995. Optional equipment available included a McIntosh sound system, racing stripes, painted brake calipers, and forged alloy wheels. From its aerodynamically optimised shape to its multifunctional buttresses to its extraordinarily powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine, everything about the Ford GT is designed to deliver pure performance. This Ford GT is the ultimate expression of form following function. Its teardrop-shape body is the result of extensive work in the wind tunnel. Its carbon-fibre body and its - 650 BHP 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6 engine are the ultimate expressions of technological innovation. The lightweight body is made of carbon fibre. Aluminium structures minimise the weight of the high-strength sub frames. Whether on the road or on the track, every single element of the Ford GT was designed to deliver the extraordinary speed and exceptional handling found only in purpose-built racing cars. Its aerodynamically optimal teardrop shape minimises drag and maximises downforce. Competition makes everyone stronger. The Ford GT is feared on the track thanks to wins all the way toLe Mans. See what happens when you give the best automotive engineers in the world the time and resources they need not just to push the envelope, but to bust right through it. And since that sort of thing winds up in the rest of our vehicles, we win races off the track as well.</p>
